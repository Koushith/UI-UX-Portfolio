            </p>
            <p>
              All the UI/UX case studies which i read starts with talking about
              research, time and energy invested in working on the project. How
              many days, weeks and months did the project finally take to
              complete. Of course this kind of working is amazing, it is great
              when you have the opportunity to work on the project carefully.
            </p>
            <p><strong>But</strong></p>
            <p>
              There are few projects when there is no time for all this and you
              have to work in a uniform situation. This project is one of themâ€¦
            </p>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              The appearance of a Corona-virus in the world has completely
              changed the agenda. almost every company had to stop working to
              prevent the spread of the virus. I thought about building an app
              which creates awareness which helps people find hospitals and
              clinics. After a few minutes of brainstorming new ideas started to
              pop up in my mind. I decided to add the queue management system to
              my app.
            </p>
            <h2>Defining the Problem</h2>

            <p>
              The idea behind the app was fully dictated by the scientific
              researches: the most effective way to stop the virus from
              spreading is its timely detection and treatment.
            </p>
            <p><strong>But</strong></p>
            <p>
              It is quite difficult to get complete information about clinics
              where people can test for corona-virus.
            </p>
            <img  class="img-responsive" src="./img/medicure/0_0NrfjnGlYD0tWFez.png" alt="" srcset="" />

            <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
            <p>
              Based on the above factors, i decided to create an mobile app
              which would combine all the clinics where coronavirus testing is
              possible and allow people:

              <ul>
                <li>See all the clinics where they could be tested for coronavirus</li>
                <li>Filter the clinics according to how many people were in the queue or which ones were closest to them.</li>
                <li> And most important, remotely hold the queue without spending too much time in the clinic waiting zone.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p><strong>Working Process</strong></p>
            <p>
              I started working on low fidelity wire-frames. At this stage was made the first visual outline on what principles the app UI/UX would build on. Later I started working on high fidelity wire-frames at which stage almost the final visual has been fully designed.

            </p>
               <p><strong>Final Steps</strong></p>

            <p>
              Finally after 8 hours of active work, i managed to finish the entire UI for each of the pages.
